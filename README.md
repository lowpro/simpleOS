# simpleOS
ASM OS basic

I wrote this operating system in September 2014 in order to better understand low-level programming, specifically assembly for x86 systems.

The OS is both small and incredibly useless, but its purpose was learning and in that regard it did well.
The OS boots, and allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. This OS had to fit in the first boot sector, as it was constructed without a filesystem as I did not want to include any filesystems written by others.

The largest challenge of the OS was fitting it into such a small space.
